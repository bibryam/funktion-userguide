=== What is serverless?


The term `serverless` just means that with lambda style programming the developer just focuses on writing `functions` only - there is no need for developers to think about managing servers or even containers.

Its not that there are no servers - of course there are - its just that developers don't need to think about them at all, they are managed for you by the platform.
