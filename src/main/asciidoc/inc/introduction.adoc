`Funktion` is an open source event driven lambda style programming model designed for http://kubernetes.io[Kubernetes].

Funktion supports over 200 of different http://camel.apache.org/components.html[event sources and connectors] including most network protocols, transports, databases, messaging systems, social networks, cloud services and SaaS offerings.

In a sense funktion is a https://www.quora.com/What-is-Serverless-Computing[serverless] approach to event driven microservices as you focus on just writing simple _functions_ in whatever programming language you prefer, then `funktion` and Kubernetes takes care of the rest. Its not that there's no servers; its more that you as the funktion developer don't have to worry about managing them!
